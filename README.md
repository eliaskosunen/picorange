# picorange

A very minimal single-header C++20 ranges implementation, written in C++11.

A large majority of this library is ported directly from NanoRange (which is C++17).
Only includes the stuff that was required for [scnlib](https://github.com/eliaskosunen/scnlib).
There's no documentation, no tests, no CI, no nothing.
It's lagging behing the standard draft.

On the other hand, it's only 2k LOC, hence [the name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico-).
